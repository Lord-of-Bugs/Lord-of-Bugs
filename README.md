### Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
#### About Me
My name is Muchan Li. I am a rising senior at UC San Diego studying Data Science and Cognitive Science and I love what I do! I am also keenly interested in computer science, with a particular focus on HCI, privacy, and security. I am dedicated to creating a positive social impact by developing software architectures and data-driven solutions where end users' privacy-sensitive information is not so easily harnessed or taken advantage of.
#### My Inspiration 
Every time I feel discouraged by obstacles, this clip from one of my favorite movies always cheers me up and puts me back on track. It is my personal source of inspiration and the reason why I love data and computer science.
