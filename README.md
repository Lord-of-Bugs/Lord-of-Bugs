# Hi there, nice to meet you 👋
## About Me 👨‍💻🛠️🔬🔐
My name is Muchan Li. I am a rising senior at UC San Diego studying Data Science and Cognitive Science and I love what I do! I am also keenly interested in computer science, with a particular focus on HCI, privacy, and security. I am dedicated to creating a positive social impact by developing software tools, systems, and frameworks, as well as data-driven solutions, so that end users' privacy-sensitive information is not so easily harnessed or taken advantage of. I aspire to become both an outstanding, cool researcher and engineer.

## My Hobbies ❤️‍🔥
I am a strong believer in the notion of a "life-long learner". I want to be able to explore as many subjects as possible, even those that I may at some time ago felt discouraged against. For those I do find interesting and passionate about, I want to be able to practice and develop them into life-long devotions. With this said, as examples, here are what I am or have always been enthusiastic about:
- Tennis 🎾 (My #1️⃣ sport)
  - While I equally appreciate Roger, Rafa, and Novak, Rafa is my 🐐
- Basketball 🏀 
  - Fun fact, I watch more commentator clips (Steven A. for example) than actual games and highlights sometimes.
- Running 🏃‍♂️
- Go ⚫⚪ (Very rusty now but the muscle memory is there)
- Hiking 🥾
- Working-out 🏋️
- Reading books 📚
- Random late-night rides and adventures 🌃🚗

## My Inspiration 🌟
Every time I feel discouraged by obstacles, this clip from one of my favorite movies always cheers me up and puts me back on track. It is my personal source of inspiration and the reason why I love data and computer science.
